Tableau for analytics:
Scatter plot:
Default confidence interval is 95% and we can't change.
Show trend lines will give you the linear regression line
Describe trend line will give you all the stats that are related to model
Transformations is not possible in tableau

Forecasting:
simple exponential.
Mandatory: Date field & 
If we have a negative value we cannot use multiplicative model for exponential smoothing technique
