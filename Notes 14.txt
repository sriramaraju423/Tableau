Calculation fields:

Dimension data will be granualized.

LOD(Level of detail):
Three types of LOD
Fixed LOD: Specified dimension without reference to other dimension
1.Table scoped fixed LOD
2.Dimension scoped LOD
Include LOD
View level + specified dimension in the formula
So the bottom line is we can build chart at very granular level keeping high level sheet
Exclude LOD
View level - Specified dimension

R can only integrate with using calculated fields.
